# Dual-Motor-EV-Resurrection-VESC-Conversion
Project Description
The core of this project is the electronic transformation of a Dualtron Eagle electric scooter by integrating a Dual Ubox Aluminum Lite controller. This initiative focuses on replacing the original, limited factory electronics with a sophisticated system based on VESC technology to unlock advanced telemetry, smoother power delivery through Field Oriented Control, and a fully customizable riding experience. By rescuing a pre-owned vehicle and upgrading its internal intelligence, this project combines sustainability with high-end power electronics engineering and practical learning. The primary goal is to take a broken or underperforming machine and give it a second life through modern open-source technology.

Why I Made This Project
I decided to build this project because I wanted to master the complex logic that governs modern electric mobility systems. Understanding the relationship between battery discharge rates, MOSFET switching frequencies, and motor torque profiles is essential for any future robotics engineer. Instead of buying a new scooter, I wanted to learn how to repair and optimize existing hardware, pushing the limits of what a standard commuter vehicle can do while gaining hands-on experience with high-voltage systems and VESC firmware.

How to Use
To operate this scooter, first turn on the main power switch located on the deck. Once the Ubox controller initializes and the display turns on, connect your smartphone via Bluetooth to the VESC Tool app to monitor real-time telemetry or adjust power curves. Use the thumb throttle on the right handlebar for acceleration and the electronic braking system for regenerative stopping. Always ensure the battery is charged within the safety limits before starting a long ride.
