# Dual-Motor-EV-Resurrection-VESC-Conversion
The project consists of the following: rescuing a second-hand electric scooter with a broken controller or that is no longer in use, recycling it, repairing any damage, and replacing the broken parts. I will swap the original controller(s) for a Dual Ubox Aluminum Lite 100V 100Ax2 (based on VESC). I will then program and configure it to ensure safety while learning about the electronics and programming behind these devices. Steps to follow: Sourcing Materials: I will search for electric scooters on Wallapop with minimal damage at a good price. I'll also source the appropriate controller (likely the Dual Ubox Aluminum Lite), find the necessary adapters to minimize soldering, and select a display and throttle compatible with VESC. Initial Inspection: Once the scooter arrives, I will check every connector and cable, ensuring the battery, motors, and chassis are in good condition. Preparation: I will purchase the required adapters to connect the scooter’s wiring to the new controller, fix any structural flaws in the chassis, and prep it for the upgrade. Assembly and Configuration: I will install the VESC, repair all necessary parts, configure the firmware, and run system tests to ensure error-free operation. Goals: With this project, I want to master the logic behind scooter electronics, understand the function of every wire, and learn how a VESC operates and how to properly configure its parameters.
